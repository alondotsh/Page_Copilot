# 📄 Page Copilot by Alon

Page Copilot by Alon is a Chrome extension for webpage reading, summarization, and cross-page research.

It focuses on two core workflows:
- Summarize the current page and continue asking follow-up questions grounded in its content
- Reference recently visited pages to compare articles, products, viewpoints, or decisions

The extension is built on Manifest V3 and supports bring-your-own model APIs, so you are not locked into a single browser or model ecosystem.
